Premise:

This is a world war 1 game. There are british and Germans. Their objective is to take the opposing trench. You and your friend are the commanders.


How to play:

Britain plays with the mouse, Germany with the keyboard. Click the buttons to put out units or to switch sound on and off. The controls are

- ANZACs/Sturmtruppen : Quicker than BEF, but more expensive(1st button for britain, 2 for germany, 100 points)

- BEF/Landwehr : Basic unit, slow but plentiful (2nd button for britain, 1 for germany, 50 points)

- Artillery : call in some shells on the enemy position (3rd button for britain, 3 for germany, 150 points)

- Gas : shell with gas clouds across the enemy frontline ! (4th button for britain, 4 for germany, 200 points)

- Escape exits during and after the game

Audio on and off should be clear

Once 10 soldiers have crossed the a side, the other side wins. But was it really worth it?
